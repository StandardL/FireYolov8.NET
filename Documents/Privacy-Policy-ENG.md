## 1. Stored Sensitive Information

When using our software, we store the captured video frames on your machine's **LOCAL DISK** for the sake of smooth detecting. They will not be uploaded to any server, and you can clear them at any time in the software's settings page.

## 2. Permission Request

In order to capture video frames, we need you provide **Web Cam** and **Microphone** permissions.

## 3. Use of Information

Developers will not provide, sell, rent, share or trade your personal information to any unrelated third party unless they have your prior permission, or the third party and the developer (including developer affiliates) provide services to you individually or jointly, and after the end of the service, they will be prohibited from accessing all such materials, including all materials that they were previously able to access.

The developer also does not allow any third party to collect, edit, sell or disseminate your personal information by any means. If any developer platform user engages in the above activities, once discovered, the developer has the right to immediately terminate the service agreement with the user.

For the purpose of serving users, developers may use your personal information to provide you with information that is of interest to you, including but not limited to sending you product and service information, or sharing information with developer partners so that they can send you information about their products and services (the latter requires your prior cons).
